I was drowning. I was attending summer camp at Pinewood lake. Some kids from the camp had pushed me in. I was cold, terrified and tried frantically to reach the surface. My lungs were burning. I could see the distorted sky fade away. The next thing I remember was waking up in my camp bed. Somebody had rescued me. But everything was grey and cold...


My body had dried I was no more cold, there was a blanket wrapped around. I got up from my slumber It was as if I had resurrected and given another chance to live. I saw a familiar face and a familiar place. It was one of the summer camps. The boy whose face I saw when I woke up, it was a familiar one. He never spoke anything to me, infact I had never seen him speak for the three days we were at the camp. 
"why did you save me ?" I enquired.
"I just saw you being pushed by some kids, I was waiting for them to leave and when I found you were barely breathing so I panicked and tried to warm you." he replied
But I had never talked to him infact I joined with other kids in making fun of him so why did he...
